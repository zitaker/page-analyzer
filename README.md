#  Page Analyzer

[Demo](https://page-analyzer-of-the-georgia.onrender.com/)  

#### A page analyzer is an application that analyzes certain pages for their SEO suitability.  
The Page Analyzer is a full â€” fledged application based on the Flask platform, using PostgreSQL. The principle of building the MVC architecture is taken: working with routing, query handlers and templating, interacting with the database. Deployment takes place on render.com .  

### Opportunities
1. Entering a url and saving it in the urls table.
2. If you make a check, the data is stored in the url_checks table and connected by a foreign key by id to the urls table.
3. Output of data from two tables.
4. Output of messages when performing checks:
   * Page added successfully.
   * The page already exists.
   * Invalid URL.
   * The URL contains more than 255 characters.
   * An error occurred during verification.
   * The page has been successfully verified.
